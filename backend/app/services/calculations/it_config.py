IT Configuration Module for Data Center Cost Modeling

This module handles IT equipment cost calculations for data center planning.
It supports both "General Purpose" and "HPC/AI" data center configurations
with flexible component-based cost modeling.

Key Features:
- Server power and hardware cost calculations
- Network infrastructure cost modeling  
- Memory and CPU component pricing
- Rack-level capacity planning
- Data center type-specific configurations

The calculations are based on industry-standard server configurations
and can be customized through function parameters or default values.

   >>> print(f"GP Server Cost: ${cost:,.2f}")

2. Calculate rack capacity for air cooling:
   >>> max_servers = calculate_maximum_number_of_chassis_per_rack_for_air(12, "HPC/AI")
   >>> print(f"Max HPC servers per rack: {max_servers}")

3. Calculate component costs separately:
   >>> cpu_cost = calculate_total_cpu_price_per_server()
   >>> memory_cost = calculate_total_memory_cost_per_server()
   >>> network_cost = calculate_total_network_cost_per_server()
   >>> bom_cost = calculate_server_l2_bom()
   >>> total = cpu_cost + memory_cost + network_cost + bom_cost

4. Custom server configuration:
   >>> custom_cost = calculate_total_it_cost_per_server(
   ...     total_cpu_price_per_server=6000,      # Higher-end CPUs
   ...     total_memory_cost_per_server=15000,   # More memory
   ... )

INTEGRATION WITH MAIN CALCULATIONS:
This module is designed to integrate with the main data center cost calculations
in main.py. The key integration points are:

- calculate_typical_it_cost_per_server(): Primary function for cost estimates
- calculate_maximum_number_of_chassis_per_rack_for_air(): For capacity planning
- calculate_number_of_server_refreshes(): For lifecycle cost modeling

CUSTOMIZATION:
All functions accept optional parameters to override defaults. For organization-
specific configurations, modify the DEFAULT_* constants at the top of the file
or pass custom values to the functions.

DATA SOURCES:
Current defaults are based on typical enterprise server configurations circa 2024.
For more accurate modeling, update defaults with:
- Vendor quotes for actual hardware costs
- Organization-specific server standards
- Current market pricing for components
- Site-specific power and cooling constraints
